CJ Cup 2025 – Golf Score Prediction &amp; Simulatio

This project analyzes and simulates the CJ Cup 2025 golf tournament using statistical modeling and data analytics. It combines **Python**, **SQL**, and **Jupyter Notebook** to forecast player performance and simulate tournament outcomes.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📈 **Linear Regression Modeling**  
  Simulated Round 1 and Round 2 scores for individual golfers using Python-based linear regression.

- 🧠 **Logistic Regression for Top Finishes**  
  Built classification models to predict each golfer’s probability of finishing in:
  - Top 5  
  - Top 10  
  - Top 20  

- 🗃️ **Data Collection & Processing with SQL**  
  - Gathered and joined datasets from sources like the PGA Tour and OWGR (Official World Golf Ranking)  
  - Cleaned and merged large datasets using advanced SQL queries  
  - Handled missing values and normalized data using both SQL and Python

- 🔄 **Tournament Cutline Simulation**  
  Incorporated a realistic tournament cutline logic: **Top 65 + ties after Round 2** to simulate progression into later rounds.

- 🎯 **Probabilistic Outcome Simulation**  
  Simulated outcomes such as:
  - Probability of winning  
  - Finishing in the Top 5, 10, or 20  
  - Based on regression models and cutline filtering  

## 📂 Tech Stack
- **Python**: pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **SQL**: Data extraction, transformation, and cleaning  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Exploratory analysis, modeling, and visualization
